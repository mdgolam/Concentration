# Concentration game

Hello! This project is the improved version of the first home assignment from the Stanford's [«Developing iOS 11 Apps with Swift»](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316) course.

## Features

Besides the original task, you'll notice **improved layout with square cards, cards turning back after some time and the final screen**. You'll also find a sketch file with an icon and another one with some theme colors.
